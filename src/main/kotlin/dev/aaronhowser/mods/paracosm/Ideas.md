# Ideas

- [ ] Mod is based on childlike imagination, everything should be kid-themed
- [ ] An imagination value (Whimsy? Wonder?) that increases when you do certain things and unlocks imagination-based
  magic
- [ ] Imagination-based things dont work/exist in the presence of people with low imagination. This even can debuff
  players with mid imagination if someone with low imagination is watching them, bc that's "proving" that it's not real
- [ ] At very very high imagination, it becomes real for everyone, like you're warping reality
- [ ] Textures and sounds are per-player, based on their imagination. So someone with low imagination will see a
  cardboard tube, someone with high imagination will see a lightsaber, or whatever
- [ ] Should things be magic by default? Maybe you have to use like a magic fairy wand on things to infuse them with
  imagination
- [ ] Maybe a BAD form of imagination, prevented by stuff like night light
- [ ] Maybe something like the witchery altar, but replace candles and heads with toys etc
- [ ] Maybe an Imaginator that turns normal things into the imaginative version

# Sources

# Uses

- [x]  Toy mob companions that do things but if someone without imagination looks at them, they flop to the ground Toy
  Story style
- [x]  A gun that if you have imagination works normal but to everyone else it sounds like me going pew pew

- [ ]  Mental dimension, mindspace etc? Storage? Mind Palace? What if it gets bigger the more imaginative you are?
- [ ]  If you go to sleep, add a button to go to a dream world
- [ ]  Halloween costumes that actually function
- [ ]  Spongebob imagination box? What would that even be, a dimension?
- [ ]  3D goggles that, at low imagination just enable stereoscopic, but at high imagination does something else. night
  vision? show secret doors?
- [x]  Towel cape. Super hero powers? Maybe a worse elytra? curio

- [ ]  Glitter that blinds you (using a new thing rather than the black blindness effect, maybe particles that obscure
  vision)
